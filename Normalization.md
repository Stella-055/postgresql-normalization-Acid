# What is Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing data within a database (relational database) to eliminate data anomalies, such as redundancy.

Data redundancy unnecessarily increases the size of the database as the same data is repeated in many places. Inconsistency problems also arise during insert, delete, and update operations

It involves breaking down a large, complex table into smaller and simpler tables while maintaining data relationships.

It is commonly used when dealing with large datasets.
